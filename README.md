This is the dwiel's version of the CEB press control code.  It is was
merged into the official version a while ago, but some new guy decided
to rewrite everything, again, and discard this code ...

It provides a pause button as well as a pressure relief sensor which will stop
all hydraulics if an over pressure sitation is detected.

This code has been used to press thousands of blocks.
